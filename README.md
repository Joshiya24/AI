# Using AI to save coral reefs
VASP uses AI, powered by Intel Xeon, Intel FPGA Programmable Acceleration Cards, and Intel Movidius VPU to count and classify the marine life.
The data collected is structured using analytics enabling researchers to make data-driven decisions that will help the reef progress

Many research papers see AI and machine learning applications as a promising approach to eliminating the bottleneck in data processing for coral reef monitoring
. The use of these technologies can enhance the speed of processes at a much-reduced form, and dramatically improve how coral reefs are measured
and monitored worldwide.
